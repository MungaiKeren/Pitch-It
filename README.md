# Project Description

An application designed to utilize 60 seconds of one's life to impress someone! 
A user submits a one minute pitch and other users votes on their pitch, leave comments and give feedback on the pitch.
Pitches are arranged in categories; Business, Creative, Innovative, Interview pitch, Art

Logged in users have their profile page where they can view the pitches they pitched and see the voteage on them, upvotes and downvotes.
